GMusic
======

GMusic is a Google Play Music client written in Python using GTK+ 3 and the [Unofficial Google Music API][1].

Warning
-------

GMusic is currently in very early development and right now is just the a few GTK windows with a menu,
don't expect anything to actually work for quite a while.

I take no responsibility for whatever happens to your system(s) if you (attempt) to install it.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2
* PyGObject
* GTK+ 3
* [Unofficial Google Music API][1]
